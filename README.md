This curated list is from the **Game Development in Rust** Discord server and prioritizes libraries and frameworks that have examples and are ready or almost ready for production.

For a longer list of libraries and frameworks, see [Are We Game Yet?](https://arewegameyet.rs).

The ⭐ emoji means that the framework is excellent for one of the reasons:

- Has many followers and maintainers.
- Might have few followers and maintainers, but is in excellent quality and passed the test of time.
- Uses modern standards (compared to peers).

## Resources to understand ECS (Entity Component System) and DOD (Data-Oriented Design)

ECS/DOD is quite a big deal in Rust. Here are some resources to understand the basics:

- [Understanding data-oriented design for entity component systems - Unity at GDC 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_Byw9UMn9g).
- [CppCon 2018: Stoyan Nikolov “OOP Is Dead, Long Live Data-oriented Design”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yy8jQgmhbAU) - Harsh title (ECS/DOD is not a silver bullet for every problem), but useful regardless.
- [RustConf 2018 - Closing Keynote - Using Rust For Game Development by Catherine West](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKLntZcp27M) - A classic presentation already - Catherine West gives several examples, explain the problems with them, and shows the alternatives.
- ["Data-Oriented Design" web book by Richard Fabian](https://dataorienteddesign.com/dodbook).

## Game engines

### 2D + 3D

- [rg3d](https://docs.rs/rg3d) Feature-rich, production-ready, general purpose 2D/3D game engine written in Rust with a scene editor.

## Graphics-only
